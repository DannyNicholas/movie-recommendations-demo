# Deploying a PostgreSQL Database to AWS using Terraform

This directory contains everything needed to deploy a PostgreSQL database to AWS using Terraform.

Everything in this directory can be customised for our specific PostgreSQL instance. The scripts within the `terraform-aws-rds` directory are considered static and should support any database instance required.

This has been adapted from the original [Terraform AWS RDS repository](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-rds).
